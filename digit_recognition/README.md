# MNIST
Applying concepts learnt in deeplearning.ai onto the MNIST dataset using Keras framework

This notebook was created with the intent of applying concepts learnt in the Deep Learning course taught by deeplearning.ai.
The dataset was extracted from Digit Recognizer @ https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

First, dataset was ran through decision tree and random forest classifiers.

Subsequently, a CNN model was ran and the accuracies of all 3 models can be compared.

Overall, CNN reigns supreme in digit recognition, with a high training accuracy of ~99% and test accuracy on unknown dataset
of ~98%.
