# Data-Science-Portfolio
---
:rocket:

This repository contains projects I have embarked on, relating to Data Science. They are presented as Python Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and Python Scripts (.py)

I got the inspiration for this layout from [this github repo](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio)

## Content

* Data Visualization and Feature Engineering
    * [Predict Titanic Passengers' Survival Rates](kaggle_titanic) - Deep dive into Kaggle's Titanic   Dataset, using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost Classifier is also used, to train a supervised model

* Supervised Machine Learning
    * [Predict Housing Prices](kaggle_housing_prices) - Predict prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables. LASSO, Ridge Regression, ElasticNet and XGBoostRegressor were used for supervised learning

* Deep Learning
    * [Digit Recognition](kaggle_digit_recognition) - Train Convolutional Neural Network models to recognize digits in images using Tensorflow and Keras
